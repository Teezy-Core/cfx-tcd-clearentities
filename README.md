# How It Works
- The system continuously monitors entity counts across the server
- Based on configured intervals, it schedules automatic clearing operations
- Before clearing, the system announces to players that entities will be removed
- When clearing, it systematically removes entities based on configuration preferences
- Administrators can view detailed statistics and manually trigger clearing through the UI

This resource is essential for any FiveM server looking to maintain performance over long operational periods, especially on busy roleplay servers where entity counts can grow significantly over time.
